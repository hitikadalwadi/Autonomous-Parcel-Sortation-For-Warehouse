# Autonomous-Parcel-Sortation-For-Warehouse
A swarm robotics system for automated package sorting using computer vision and centralized navigation control
# Project Overview
This project implements an autonomous parcel sorting system using mobile robots with centralized monitoring and navigation. The system uses computer vision for robot tracking and package destination identification
# Features
* Centralized Navigation System: Overhead camera system for real-time robot tracking and control
* Computer Vision Integration: ArUco markers for robot orientation tracking and QR code scanning for package destinations
* MQTT Communication: Real-time command transmission between central system and robots
* Precision Control: Stepper motors for accurate movement and servo motors for package dropping
* Swarm Intelligence: Multiple robots working collaboratively to maximize throughput
* Real-time Performance: Average task completion time of 20-25 seconds per package
